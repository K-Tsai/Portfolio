			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				I am a web developer who is currently taking the Full Stack Flex bootcamp at Thinkful.
				My interests include video games, anime, technology, travel, and experiencing new things.
				I previously learned about HTML/CSS and JavaScript while I was in college. This sparked my
				interest on the subject which motivated me to learn more about web development.
				I plan on finding a career as a Front End Web Developer upon graduating from this 
				course.

				   	This is a Quiz App that I designed recently using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. As a
						lover of video games I have designed this app to challenge your knowledge on nostalgic 
						video games from my past.
